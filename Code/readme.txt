Project Description 
------------------- 
 
The project is to create a small carbon dioxide level detector which can be fit into vehicles, rooms or offices of factories which will alarm a buzzer if its level increases above a certain threshold. Plus, the readings are sent via wifi to a server (which can be there in the nearest service center).
